# 2026-02-15 - Memory Log

## Events
- **08:33** - Daily cron job for Beijing weather report completed and shared with user.
- **17:04** - User requested a complex multi-agent architecture involving 6 Feishu bots mapped to 6 distinct roles/Agents (Project Manager, Product Manager, UI Designer, Backend/Frontend Engineers, QA).
- **17:15** - Diagnosed configuration errors in user's backup file: incorrect usage of `agents.entries` (should be `list`) and conflicting channel IDs.
- **17:20** - **Major Change**: Reconfigured OpenClaw to support multi-account Feishu integration.
    - Backed up original config to `openclaw.json.backup_agent_task`.
    - Applied new `openclaw.json` with 6 Agents and 6 Feishu accounts.
    - Set `main` agent to "Project Manager" role with workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspaces/project_manager`.
    - Successfully restarted the gateway.

## Decisions & Context
- Transitioned from a single-agent setup to a specialized multi-agent squad.
- The "Project Manager" bot is now the primary point of contact for the `main` session.
- Each role has an isolated workspace under `~/.openclaw/workspaces/`.

## Technical Status
- Current Model: `google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash` (Primary).
- Multi-agent routing is active via `channels.feishu.accounts`.
